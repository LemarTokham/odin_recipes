    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>50g unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>3 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>75g plain flour, sifted onto a piece of baking paper</li>
        <li>2 medium eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to gas 8, 220°C, fan 200°C. </li>
        <li>Put the butter, 1½ tsp sugar and 150ml water in a saucepan over a low heat.
             As soon as the butter has melted, remove from the heat and add the flour and a pinch of salt.
             Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon until you have a thick paste that comes away from the side of the pan, about 2 mins. 
        </li>
        <li>Spread the paste out on a plate to cool for roughly 5 mins until lukewarm.
             Return to the pan and beat in the eggs, a little at a time, until the mixture is glossy and slowly falls off a spoon with a tap.
              Transfer to a piping bag. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pipe 16 walnut-sized mounds of the mixture onto 2 nonstick baking sheets, spacing them 2-3cm apart.
             Use a wet finger to gently press down any peaks, then transfer to the oven.
              Bake for 5 mins, then lower the oven temperature to gas 4, 180°C, fan 160°C and bake for a further 15-20 mins until the profiteroles are golden, crisp and well risen.
             Make a small hole in the side of each using a skewer and set on a wire rack to cool completely. 
        </li>
        <li>To make the sauce, put the chocolate and sugar in a small saucepan with 100ml water.
             Heat gently to melt the chocolate, then simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring occasionally, until thickened and syrupy. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pile the profiteroles onto a serving plate and pour over the hot chocolate sauce.
             As an alternative, dip each profiterole in the sauce and divide between plates to serve.
             They will keep for up to 2 days in an airtight container in the fridge.
        </li>
    </ol>
